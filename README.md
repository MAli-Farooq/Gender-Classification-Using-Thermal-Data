This Repository contails all the fine-tuned pretrained and newly Proposed models trained on tufts thermal dataset

1. To run and check the results of each of the pretrained models run Pretrianed_models_testing.ipynb script in notebook

2. To check the results of GENNet model run Transfer_learning_script.iypnb and to retrain the entire model from scratch run Training_script.ipynb.

3. To check the result of each pretrained models as well as GENNet model download all the models from the below provided link.
