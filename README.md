Gender Classification Using Thermal Data  

This Repository contails all the fine-tuned pretrained and newly Proposed models trained on tufts thermal dataset

1. To run and check the results of each of the pretrained models run Pretrianed_models_testing.ipynb script in notebook

2. To check the results of GENNet model run GENNet_Transfer_learning_script.iypnb and to retrain the entire model from scratch run Training_script.ipynb.

3. To check the result of each pretrained models as well as GENNet model download all the models from the below provided link.

6. To retrain the pretrained models and fine-tune the models on thermal data run Pretrained_Models_Retraining.iypnb and Thermal_Data_Transfer_learning_script scripts.

In case of any quries you can write email to me
